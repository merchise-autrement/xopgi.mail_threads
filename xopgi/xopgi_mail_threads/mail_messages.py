'''Appends raw email to 'mail.message' module.

.. note:: On using `store_original`.

   OpenERP's mail system may save the original email, but it does so as an
   attachment.  We feel this is mistaken, cause an attachment is an integral
   part of the message and thus it should not be "created" by technical
   reasons.  A valid scenario for automatically creating an attachment should
   be business-driven.
