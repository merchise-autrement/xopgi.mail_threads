'''Transports for outgoing emails.

Transports allow to fully override OpenERP's internal mechanisms for send
emails.  Once an email needs to be sent a transport may choose to either
further instruct how to send it by the OpenERP internal mail_server or to
deliver itself.

        .. versionchanged:: 2.5 You may also return a tuple of ``(result,
           data)``.  The first component should be the boolean value as
           before.  The ``data`` part is an object that will be passed as the
           ``data`` keyword argument of the `prepare_message`:meth: method.

        This is useful to avoid computing things twice in `query` and in
        `prepare_message`:meth:.

    def deliver(self, server, message, data):
        '''Deliver if possible the message.

        Return False if the transport won't do the delivery directly.  This
        will delegate the delivery to OpenERP's ``send_email`` method.

        Return the Message-Id string if the delivery was successful.  This
        only means that the transport could properly deliver the message to
        next hop in the chain not that message was actually delivered to its
        final destination.

        You should pass both the ``message`` and ``connection_data`` objects
        returned by `prepare_message`:func:.

        Inside this method the ``send_email`` method of the ``ir.mail_server``
        object can be used and the transport won't be re-elected but another
        one will.  This allows for several transports to kick in and do their
        magic as a pipeline.  Notice this may, however, slow the delivery.

        Transports are not meant for the unwary users, but for system
        designers.  Furthermore, the order in which they will be elected is
        not defined.

        The ``message`` attribute is the message that OpenERP will actually
        send, while ``connection_data`` will be used to instruct the
        ``send_email`` method of ``ir.mail_server`` how to send it if the
        `deliver`:func: indicates it.

        The ``data`` keyword argument is the second component if the return
        value of the `query`:meth: method.  You may use that data to avoid
        redoing stuff you did in the `query` method.
