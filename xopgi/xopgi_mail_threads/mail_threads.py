'''Extends OpenERP mail detection strategies.

Odoo's mail addon has only four strategies to select a message's thread id or
create a new one.

Those strategies work for most cases, but some fail.  At the same time, those
are packed into a single method ``message_route`` which is responsible to
select the messages several targets (threads).  This makes harder to extend
how those strategies apply.

Our current solution is two folded:

- First allow OpenERP to select their targets.

- Then allow other `Mail Routers <MailRouter>`:class: to process the results
  as they see fit.
