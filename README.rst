 Merchise's General Extensions to OpenERP Mail Threads
=======================================================

Overview
========

Generalizes how OpenERP searches for incoming message's threads.  Several mail
implementations (like that of Evaneos) don't include the "References:" and
"In-Reply-To:", different strategies are needed for these cases.

This addons allows to register different strategies.
